\chapter*{The \sectionsovs nomenclature}
Names are actually pretty useful, maybe even moreso than you usually think. Take it from someone who takes an extremely long time memorizing the names of new acquaintances: not being able to properly address someone/something and having to resort to ``Hey you!'' and ``That thing over there!'' get's old pretty fast. This same principle of course also applies to \sovs: it's a lot more tiresome to say: ``he did that that move where he raised his hand and she turned and swung a fist at him'' than ``he took her for a \textit{rundtenom} and she responded with a \textit{svinger}''. \\
More than just allowing for precise communication of the actions on the dance floor, the nomenclature of \sovs also captures an essential part of Danish culture and it's love for naming things in a kind of naughty and street-wise manner, known and cherised from classics such as: \textit{bingo-lingo} and \textit{pÃ¸lse-slang}.

\section*{Names of figures}
As any valid figure from Cuban Salsa is also a valid figure in \sovs, the names of figures are more or less direct translations of figures from Cuban Salsa.
